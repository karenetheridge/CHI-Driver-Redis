  - Use hashes to store info rather than crazy sets and keys.

    Redis.pm so CHI can handle it.
  - Bump dependency versions.

0.04    2010-03-17
  - Separate ping check from reconnection exceptions so that being disconnected
    doesn't become a permanent problem.  We now reconnect when Redis comes back.

0.03    2010-03-17
  - PODed implementation details
  - Conditional tests

0.02    2009-12-22
  - POD updates
  - Rename _redis attribute to redis
  - Lazily set redis attribute so that it is not populated until the first
    use.  This – plus some new error handling – prevent crazy explosions when
    Redis isn't available at instantiation time.
  - Add warning for when ->ping fails

0.01    2009-10-09
  - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
